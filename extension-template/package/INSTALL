INSTALL
=======

On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install this package using the
following common steps:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you need to customize the target directories, or otherwise adjust the build
setting, use

    ./configure --help

to list the configure options.

If the `configure` script is missing from your package you need to create it by
running the `bootstrap` script. Use the `--noconfigure` parameter in order to
prevent `bootstrap` from running automatically `configure` immediately after
having generated it. To list different options use `bootstrap --help`.
